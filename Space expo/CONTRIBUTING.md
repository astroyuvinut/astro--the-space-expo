   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

3. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   python -m pytest
   ```

4. **Start Development**
   ```bash
   # Run the optimized Streamlit app
   streamlit run app/streamlit_app_optimized.py

   # Or use the CLI
   python -m src.orbits.pass_predictor_optimized --help
   ```

## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions
- **Bug fixes** - Fix existing issues
- **Features** - Add new functionality
- **Documentation** - Improve docs, tutorials, or examples
- **Tests** - Add or improve test coverage
- **Performance** - Optimize existing code
- **UI/UX** - Improve user interfaces

### Finding Issues to Work On
- Check the [Issues](https://github.com/yourusername/space-expo-satellite-predictor/issues) page
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted`
- Check the project roadmap in the README

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Write descriptive variable and function names
- Keep functions focused on single responsibilities
- Add docstrings to all public functions

### Commit Messages
Use conventional commit format:
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New features
- `fix`: Bug fixes
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```
feat: add support for custom TLE sources
fix: handle network timeouts in TLE fetching
docs: update installation instructions
```

### Branch Naming
- Use descriptive names: `feature/add-satellite-database`, `fix/tle-parsing-bug`
- Base feature branches on `main`
- Keep branches focused on single features/fixes

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_pass_predictor.py

# Run performance tests
python performance_comparison.py
```

### Writing Tests
- Place tests in `tests/` directory
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Mock external dependencies (API calls, file I/O)

### Test Coverage
- Aim for >90% code coverage
- Focus on critical paths and error conditions
- Include integration tests for key workflows

## Submitting Changes
